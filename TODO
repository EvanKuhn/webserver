nu_unit
- support verbose and non-verbose modes
- support different error types:
  - nu_check() just logs a failure, but the test continues
  - nu_assert() logs a failure and causes the current test to exit
  - nu_assert_or_die() logs a failure and causes all testing to stop
- upload to github

At end of tests, check for and kill all child processes

Get webserver responding to some basic request
- Test with 'curl'
- Start with HEAD and GET?

Add support for HTTP headers
- need to figure out which ones to start with

We will need a config file to house settings:
- MAX_PENDING_CONNS
- CLIENT_SOCKET_RECV_BUFFER_SIZE
- ...
