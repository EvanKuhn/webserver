Set up Rakefile and rspec tests

webserver
- needs signal handling to properly shut down socket
- config file reader
- allow us to set the file-storage-root at the command line
  - use this during testing so we can set our own test pages
- silent and/or verbose options
- add string class (see ~/dev/scratch/source/)

We will need a config file to house settings:
- FILE_STORAGE_ROOT
- MAX_PENDING_CONNS
- CLIENT_SOCKET_RECV_BUFFER_SIZE
- ...

At end of tests, check for and kill all child processes

Why can't I quickly close and reopen a socket on the same port?
- Need to test by opening a server socket, closing, and reopening
