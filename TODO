Set up Rakefile and rspec tests

webserver
- needs signal handling to properly shut down socket
- config file reader
- allow us to set the file-storage-root at the command line
  - use this during testing so we can set our own test pages
- silent and/or verbose options

nu_unit
- ability to provide command-line args
  - for output level:  -l/level <t,test,s,suite>
  - to run one suite:  -s/--suite <suite>
  - for help:          -h, --help

We will need a config file to house settings:
- FILE_STORAGE_ROOT
- MAX_PENDING_CONNS
- CLIENT_SOCKET_RECV_BUFFER_SIZE
- ...

At end of tests, check for and kill all child processes

Why can't I quickly close and reopen a socket on the same port?
