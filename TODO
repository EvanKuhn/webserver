Socket shutdown
- Needs signal handling to properly shut down socket
- Why can't I quickly close and reopen a socket on the same port?
  - Need to test by opening a server socket, closing, and reopening

Configuration
- Support 3 levels of configuration, in order:
  - hardcoded defaults
  - config file
  - command-line
- Sample fields:
  - FILE_STORAGE_ROOT
  - MAX_PENDING_CONNS
  - CLIENT_SOCKET_RECV_BUFFER_SIZE
- Need ConfigFile class
- Override file-storage-root at command line so we can use our own test pages

Testing
- At end of tests, check for and kill all child processes
- Tests for logging functions
