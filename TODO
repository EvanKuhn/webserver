nu_unit
- ability to provide command-line args? (ie. for output level)
- write README
- use as submodule (?) in webserver

We will need a config file to house settings:
- MAX_PENDING_CONNS
- CLIENT_SOCKET_RECV_BUFFER_SIZE
- ...

At end of tests, check for and kill all child processes

Get webserver responding to some basic request
- Test with 'curl'
- Start with HEAD and GET?

Add support for HTTP headers
- need to figure out which ones to start with
