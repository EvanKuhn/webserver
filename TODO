HttpRequest class and tests

New socket functionality and tests
- client_socket_clear_data()
- server_socket_accept_poll_should_wait() tests: makes surethe accept-poll
  function doesn't immediately timeout
- server_socket_set_blocking_test()
- Function to get socket flags?
- At end of tests, check for and kill all child processes

Get webserver responding to some basic request
- Test with 'curl'
- Start with HEAD and GET?

Add support for HTTP headers
- need to figure out which ones to start with

We will need a config file to house settings:
- MAX_PENDING_CONNS
- ...



Scratch stuff:

uint16_t client_socket_get_port(ClientSocket* s) {
  return ntohs(s->addr.sin_port);
}

char* client_socket_get_ip_str(ClientSocket* s) {
  inet_ntoa(s->addr.sin_addr);
}
